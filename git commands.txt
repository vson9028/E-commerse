1] TO CREATE A NEW REPOSETORY WE HAVE TO EXECUTE ONE COMMAND CALLED 
=> git init
this command will initialised a new git reposetory in same folder 


2] to show the status of our file which are available in our workspace
=> git status


3] to add file from workpace to staging area       3.1] to add all files from workpace to staging area   3.2] to add a specific file from workpace to staging area
=> git add                                         => git add -a                                             => git add a.txt b.txt



4] as soon as the file is available in staging area then we have to move them to local reposetory by using following command
=> git commit -m "this is my first commit"
but before commiting we have to execute some configuration commands so we have to tell git which user commiting these changes like user email , name 
we have to specify. this has to be done only one time before commiting.
the configuration command is
=> git config --global user.email "mayursawant9028@gmail.com"
once above command is executed we have to execute one more command
=> git config --global user.name "mayursawant"

5] to check how many commit you do earlier
=> git log

6] to add modified files from workspace to local reposetory
==> git commit -a -m "both files are modified..."

7] to copy project from github
==> git clone

8] to create file through command
==> git
